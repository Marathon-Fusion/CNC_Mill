# WorkingCNCConfig

This directory contains configuration files and macros for the CNC Mill Firmware project.

## Structure

- **Macros**: Custom macros used for CNC mill operations.  
    **Note:** Macros have an `M` suffix to improve syntax highlighting in VS Code.

- **Configuration Files**: Settings and parameters for firmware operation.

## Uploading files to Duet board

Either:
- Copy this whole directory to the micro SD card in the Duet board
- Upload files one-by-one from Duet Web Control 

## Notes

- The `M` suffix on macro files is intentional and helps with syntax highlighting in VS Code.
- Ensure you back up your configuration files before making changes.


## TODOs
- Some note about firmware bin files
- What to do if it gets bricked
